# Reconciliation Walkthrough

This section provides examples of **Reconciliation workflows**, focusing on scenarios where manual intervention is required to complete the process.

During the reconciliation process, the system attempts to automatically match **Bank Statements**, **Remittance Records**, and **Patient Tracker Data**. When records cannot be fully matched due to missing or inconsistent information, the system allows users to manually reconcile them.

The walkthroughs here demonstrate:

- **Unmatched References:** Examples where uploaded records cannot be matched automatically.
- **Partial Matches:** Cases where some data is present but additional manual input is needed.
- **Manual Reconciliation Process:** How to identify and resolve unmatched records.

Use these examples to familiarize yourself with expected system behavior during reconciliation and to practice resolving common issues.
